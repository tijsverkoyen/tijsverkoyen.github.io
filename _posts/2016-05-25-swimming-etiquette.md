I really love to swim, and I do so on regular bases.

Swimming is pretty easy, it doesn't require a lot of gear. But I think *some* people tend to forget the most important
thing, namely: using their brains.

In the pool there are unwritten rules, which are followed by most people because they use common sense. But for 
those who don't, here are the unwritten rules written down:

1. The lane closest to the entrance/exit is the slowest lane, the one on the other side is the fast-lane. So join one
   that fits your own speed.
2. If there is an empty lane, use that lane. With respect to the first rule.
3. Use circle swimming, see below.
4. Tap feet to pass. When your feet are tapped, move out of the way at the **end** of the lane. 
   Do **not** speed up if someone is passing you.
5. When resting, do this on the absolute sides of the lane.

And a free bonus-rule: Do not mix strokes. Crawl and breaststroke do not mix.

### Circle swimming

Circle swimming is used when there are multiple people in the same lane. Everyone in the lane swims on the right. This 
means swimming on one side of the lane going down and the other side of the lane coming back.

When you join other people, or rejoin the active swimmers, do **not** start when a swimmer is about to turn.

If you are in front of faster people allow them to pass you at the lane end, before rejoining.

Keep these in mind, mankind will be grateful.
