As is tradition, a new blog should start with a "Hello World" post. So here we are.

It has been a while since I had a personal site or blog. I deleted it a few years ago because I did not feel that it had
any added value, nor did I feel I needed another place to show my skills, as there are a lot of better places for them, 
eg.: [GitHub](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen).

But at the recent past I felt the need for a place to write some smaller articles, so this is and will be the start of
my very own personal site.

Do not expect big articles about which technology is best, nor articles about how you can write the best code you
have ever seen, nor articles about what I eat, ... What I will do is very simple: I will write whatever I want.

Some articles will be in Dutch, some in English. Some of them will have a lot of context, some of them will be just
personal articles, about stuff I don't want to forget.

I hope you will enjoy some of them.
