As there is no support for [ActiveCollab](https://activecollab.com/) in [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) I
build this work-around. With this hack you can use the `Open Task` functionality inside PhpStorm.

You can find all instructions on the [ActiveCollab Generic Server repository](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/active-collab-generic-server).
