Like usual, every marketing departments likes to lift on the <strike>success</strike>hype of people wandering around 
like zombies looking for food.

So some phone providers launched campaigns with free traffic for the Pokémon GO data.

Proximus does this also, but I can't find their tweet, instead they have this article on their website:
 [http://www.proximus.be/pokemon](http://www.proximus.be/pokemon)

But there is a really big issue with this kind of marketing-campaigns. Since they don't rate the Pokemon Go traffic, they
are [zero rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating). In direct violation with [Net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) 
since they're not treating all data the same.

Ofcourse their is a legion of lawyers involved in this kind of actions, and so this kind of actions is legal, because the 
EU Regulations have been a pity, and allow some loopholes. Also Belgium doesn't have any laws regulating Net neutrality (yet).

I really think marketeers should think before they act. They should check with their legal department if there is a 
gray-zone (because Belgium does not have implemented the EU-regulations).

Maybe they should treat all the data the same and just don't charge for *all* mobile data instead.
