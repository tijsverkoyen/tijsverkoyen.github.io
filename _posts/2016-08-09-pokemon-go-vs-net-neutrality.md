Like usual, every marketing departments likes to lift on the <strike>success</strike>hype of people wandering around 
like zombies looking for food.

So some phone providers launched campaigns with free traffic for the Pokémon GO data.

Proximus does this also, but I can't find their tweet, instead they have this article on their website:
 [http://www.proximus.be/pokemon](http://www.proximus.be/pokemon)

But there is a real big issue with this kind of marketing-campaigns. As they don't rate the traffic for Pokémon Go, they
are "[zero rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating)" this traffic.

In my opinion, this is in direct violation with the [Net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) principles 
as they don't treat all data in the same.

Ofcourse their is a legion of lawyers involved in this kind of actions, and so this kind of actions is legal, because the 
EU Regulations has been a pity, and allowed some loopholes. Also Belgium doesn't have any laws regulating the Net neutrality (yet).

I really think some marketeers should get some kicks in their balls, just for having these idea's and execute them, while
there is a gray zone on this regulations. It would charm them if they stood up and tell the general public about not 
being able to zero rate the traffic for Pokémon, Spotify, ... because of the net neutrality. Or just drop the costs for 
mobile data at all ;-)
